# Graphs

Graphs have vertices and edges. Edges can have direction and/or weight. If a graph is directed then every edge must have a direction, and if it is weighted then every edge must have a weight.

|V| = # of vertices
|E| = # of edges

**Undirected Density**
density = |E| / (|V| * (|V| - 1))

Sparse Graph: a graph with a small number of edges relative to the amount there could be (low density)
