# Merge Sort

Recursively separates array in half until all pieces are single element arrays, then merges the arrays into sorted arrays.

* Stable time complexity
* Space complexity linear, because it constructs one branch at a time (behaving like a DFS), so it only takes the space of one branch

* Time: O(n log n)
* Space: O(n)
