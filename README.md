### Sorts

* [Quick Sort](./sorts/quick_sort)
* [Merge Sort](./sorts/merge_sort)
* [Heap Sort](./sorts/heap_sort)
* [Selection Sort](./sorts/selection_sort)
* [Insertion Sort](./sorts/insertion_sort)
* [Bubble Sort](./sorts/bubble_sort)

In terms of practical performance and frequency of usage the top three sorts are (in order):

1. Quick Sort (Fastest on average, because of caching)
2. Merge Sort (Stable in terms of speed and order)
3. Heap Sort (Stable and best on space, but not as fast, because it doesn't utilize caching as effectively as merge sort and quick sort)
